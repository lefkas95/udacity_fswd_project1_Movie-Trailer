# Project: Movie Trailer Website

## Task

You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

## Generate the application page

To dynamically generate the web page for our application simply execute the command `python entertainment_center.py`. This will generate a HTML document and automatically open it in the browser.

## Open the application

To open the application simply open the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file with a standard browser which supports HTML5.
That's it.

In the same folder you can find the source files of the project.

- media.py: Contains a basic class-structor to store movie informations.
- entertainment_center.py: Defines the movies which should show up and then generates the HTML file.
